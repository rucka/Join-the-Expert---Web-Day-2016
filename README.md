# Join the Expert WebDay 2016 @UgiDotNet
Here both the slides and demos of my session "Typescript: A stitch in time saves nine" @UgiDotNet - [Join the Expert Web Day 2016]( http://www.ugidotnet.org/eventi/48/Join-the-Expert--Web-Day).

## System requirements

In order to run the web project you need Visual Studio 2015: open the project with the IDE, build and run.
If not, you can try the demo just following this steps:
- convert Views/Home/Hello.aspx, Views/Customer/Register.aspx Views/Customer/Completed.aspx pages to html (follow [this guid](https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-convert-ASP-NET-razor-view-pages-cshtml-into-plain-html-view-pages-in-Entity-Framework-ADO-NET-data-model) if you need)
- install [Typescript compiler locally](https://www.typescriptlang.org/index.html#download-links) 
- reference the compiled javascript from html.

## Slides
The slide markup has been compatible with [Deckset app for OSX](http://www.decksetapp.com). If you need, you can give a try of the trial version available in the [website](http://www.decksetapp.com/try.html).
